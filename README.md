# api
An Node.js API, developed in NLW04 (Next Level Week 04)

The project itself is a NPS (Net Promoting Score) Calculator, where the user register himself in the API, the admin creates the questions ,and the API sends an email to about a satisfaction survey containing all the questions that the admin created.

I'm utilizing Insomnia as an interface for interacting with the API, as for framework, Express.js is more than enough to run the application, for testing i'm using JEST.
